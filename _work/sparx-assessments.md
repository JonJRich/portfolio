GCSEs are a big deal. For students they unlock the next stage of their education. For teachers they're the benchmark they'll be judged by.

With teachers already stretched thin, any new tool they adopt must not simply save them time, that's the table stakes. It must also make their life easier.

To achieve this we pored over every flow, questioning the cognitive load we were putting on them. We split Revision and Assessments into two separate areas so it matched how teachers actually work. And broke set up down into 5 simple steps, with no more than 3 fields each.

In the first term, teachers from over 400 schools entered exam data for over 50,000 students. Building the foundations for the UK's largest GCSE mocks dataset. Something our competitors could only dream of.
