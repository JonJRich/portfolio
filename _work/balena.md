Designing for a fast-growing scale-up is a wild ride. With 25% year-on-year growth, balena needed everything at once. Flagship product improvements reaching millions of users. A design system built from scratch. Internal tooling for the team. I got stuck into all of it.

I rebuilt balenaHub's interface, making it easier for developers to discover and share IoT projects. Led product and design for Jellyfish, their internal communication tool, managing a team of six engineers to build something the company actually wanted to use. Created their first token-based design system. It gave the team consistency and a shared language they'd never had.

Working in a B2B startup meant getting close to the users. I joined support shifts to hear frustrations firsthand. Ran research sessions to understand what developers actually needed. Then used those insights to make decisions across marketing sites, web applications, and everything in between.
